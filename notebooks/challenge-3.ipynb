    "This notebook implements the multi-agent AI system for reviewing, suggesting, and validating updates to AAOIFI standards as specified in Challenge 3 of the hackathon.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll focus on developing three specialized agents:\n",
    "1. **Review & Extraction Agent**: Processes the selected standard to extract key elements, definitions, principles, scope, recognition criteria, measurement rules, and disclosure requirements.\n",
    "2. **Enhancement Agent**: Suggests modifications/enhancements by comparing with other standards, analyzing contemporary financial instruments, and identifying improvement areas.\n",
    "3. **Validation Agent**: Validates proposed changes for compliance with AAOIFI principles and Shariah requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this implementation, we'll focus on **FAS 10** (Istisna'a and Parallel Istisna'a)."

    "Our multi-agent system successfully analyzes FAS 10, proposes enhancements, and validates them against Shariah principles. This approach demonstrates how AI can assist in improving Islamic finance standards while ensuring compliance with fundamental principles.\n",

    "Potential next steps include:\n",
    "1. Extending the system to handle other AAOIFI standards (FAS 4, FAS 32, etc.)\n",
    "2. Improving the retrieval system with more sophisticated chunking and embedding approaches\n",
    "3. Adding more specialized agents (e.g., for specific aspects like translation, examples generation)\n",
    "4. Creating a visual interface for interacting with the system\n",
    "5. Implementing a continuous improvement mechanism that learns from user feedback"
