    "# Challenge 2: Reverse Transactions Analyzer (Gemini Version)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements an AI solution for the \"Reverse Transactions\" category of the \"Strengthening the Adoption of Standards in Islamic Finance with Artificial Intelligence\" Hackathon.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "Given \"out-of-context\" financial entries (journal entries and brief context), our AI solution will identify the relevant AAOIFI Financial Accounting Standard(s) (FAS) that govern such transactions. If multiple FAS are possible, the system provides a weighted probability and reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "1. Process and index the AAOIFI standards (FAS and SS) using RAG techniques with Google's Gemini embedding model\n",
    "2. Create a specialized prompt engineering system for reverse transaction analysis \n",
    "3. Provide weighted probability estimations for applicable standards\n",
    "4. Justify the analysis with references to specific sections of the standards"
