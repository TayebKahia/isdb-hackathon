Here are the actionable tasks for the hackathon participants, with explanations:

**General Task (Implicit):** Familiarize thoroughly with the 5 selected AAOIFI FAS (4, 7, 10, 28, and 32) and their corresponding AAOIFI Shariah Standards (SS) as per **Pre-requisites (Page 1, Source 3)**.

---

**Challenge Category 1: Use Case Scenarios***(Reference: Page 2, Source 6; Example on Page 3-4, Source 15-25)*

- **Core Objective:** To develop an AI solution that can process a given Islamic finance scenario, understand the accounting question, and generate the correct accounting treatment and journal entries, aligning with a provided correct answer. The AI should bridge the gap between its own generated answer and the target correct answer.
- **Task Example: Ijarah MBT Accounting (Lessee's books)***(Reference: Page 3-4, Source 15-25)*
    1. **Understand the Scenario:**
        - An Islamic bank (Lessee) enters an Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek (MBT - a lease ending with transfer of ownership) for a generator.
        - Key data: Asset purchase price (USD 450,000), import tax (USD 12,000), freight charges (USD 30,000). (Source 15, 16)
        - Ijarah term: 2 years. Expected residual value: USD 5,000. (Source 17)
        - Ownership transfer option likely to be exercised at USD 3,000. (Source 18)
        - Yearly rental: USD 300,000. Right of use (ROU) amortized yearly. (Source 19)
        - **Question:** Provide the initial recognition accounting entry in the Lessee's books using the Underlying Asset Cost Method. (Source 20)
    2. **Develop AI to Replicate the Correct Solution (Source 21-23):**
        - **Step 1: Calculate the Right-of-Use (ROU) Asset.**
            - Determine Prime Cost: $450,000 (purchase) + $12,000 (tax) + $30,000 (freight) = $492,000$. (Source 22)
            - Adjust for transfer of ownership: $492,000 - $3,000 (purchase price for ownership) = $489,000 (ROU Asset). (Source 22)
            - *AI's role:* Extract these figures from the scenario and perform the calculation.
        - **Step 2: Calculate Deferred Ijarah Cost.**
            - Total rentals: $300,000/year \times 2 \text{ years} = $600,000$. (Source 22)
            - Deferred Ijarah Cost: $600,000 (Total Rentals) - $489,000 (ROU Asset) = $111,000$. (Source 22)
            - *AI's role:* Calculate total lease payments and then the deferred cost.
        - **Step 3: Formulate the Journal Entry.** (Source 23)
            - Dr. Right of Use Asset (ROU) USD 489,000
            - Dr. Deferred Ijarah Cost USD 111,000
            - Cr. Ijarah Liability USD 600,000
            - *AI's role:* Construct the correct journal entry with calculated amounts.
        - **Step 4: (For subsequent amortization) Calculate Amortizable Amount.** (Source 24)
            - Cost of ROU: $489,000$.
            - Less: Terminal value difference ($5,000 \text{ residual} - $3,000 \text{ purchase option}) = $2,000$. (This $2,000 represents a net benefit to the lessee upon ownership transfer, as the asset's residual value is higher than the price paid to acquire it at lease end). (Source 24, 25)
            - Amortizable Amount: $489,000 - $2,000 = $487,000$.
            - *AI's role:* Perform this calculation for subsequent accounting periods.
- **Relevance to Islamic Finance Principles:**
    - **Ijarah MBT:** This is a specific type of Islamic lease contract where the intention is eventual ownership transfer. Its accounting differs from conventional finance leases and operating leases. AAOIFI standards provide specific guidance.
    - **Asset Recognition (ROU):** Unlike conventional operating leases, Ijarah MBT often leads to the lessee recognizing an ROU asset and a corresponding liability, reflecting the economic substance of the transaction (control and benefits of the asset).
    - **Prohibition of Riba (Interest):** The "Deferred Ijarah Cost" is not interest but rather represents the portion of lease payments that exceeds the direct cost of the ROU asset, spread over the lease term. The structure aims to avoid explicit interest charges.
    - **Substance over Form:** The accounting treatment emphasizes the economic reality that the lessee will likely own the asset.

---

**Challenge Category 2: Reverse Transactions***(Reference: Page 2, Source 7, 8; Examples on Page 5-6, Source 26-33)*

- **Core Objective:** Given "out-of-context" financial entries (journal entries and brief context), the AI solution must induce the relevant AAOIFI Financial Accounting Standard(s) (FAS) that govern such transactions. If multiple FAS are possible, the AI should provide a weighted probability and reasoning. The AI should also be able to fix discrepancies if its initial induction differs from a provided correct answer.
- **Task Example 1: GreenTech Exit and Buyout***(Reference: Page 5, Source 26-29)*
    1. **Understand the Scenario:**
        - Context: GreenTech exits in Year 3, and Al Baraka Bank buys out its stake. (Source 26)
        - Adjustments: Buyout Price: $1,750,000; Bank Ownership: 100%. (Source 27)
        - Accounting Treatment: Derecognition of GreenTech's equity; Recognition of acquisition expense. (Source 27)
        - Journal Entry for Buyout: Dr. GreenTech Equity $1,750,000 / Cr. Cash $1,750,000. (Source 27, 28)
        - **Challenge:** Identify applicable AAOIFI FAS with weighted probability and reason. (Source 29)
    2. **Develop AI to Identify FAS:**
        - The AI needs to analyze keywords ("buyout," "stake," "derecognition of equity," "acquisition") and the journal entry.
        - The AI should correlate these with the scope and content of various AAOIFI FAS.
        - The provided "Correct Answer" is: FAS 4 (Investment in Associates and Joint Ventures) as highest weight, potentially FAS 20 (Financial Instruments: Investments in Sukuk, Shares and Similar Instruments) as second, and FAS 32 (Ijarah) as third. (Source 29)
        - *AI's task:* The AI should output a similar list, with justifications. For instance:
            - **FAS 4:** Relevant if GreenTech was an associate or JV of Al Baraka Bank, and now the bank is acquiring full control or disposing of its share. The term "buyout" and "100% ownership" suggests a change in control or consolidation.
            - **FAS 20:** Applicable if the "stake" refers to an investment in shares or similar instruments.
            - **FAS 32 (Ijarah):** The relevance of FAS 32 is less direct from the provided snippet. The AI would need to find a rationale, or the hackathon team might need to infer a missing context (e.g., GreenTech's primary assets were Ijarah assets, or the entity being bought out was an Ijarah SPV). *This highlights a potential ambiguity or need for deeper contextual understanding for the AI.*
- **Task Example 2: Contract Reversal***(Reference: Page 6, Source 30-33)*
    1. **Understand the Scenario:**
        - Context: Client cancels a change order, reverting to original contract terms. (Source 30)
        - Adjustments: Revised Contract Value back to $5,000,000; Timeline Restored: 2 years. (Source 31)
        - Accounting Treatment: Adjustment of revenue and cost projections; Reversal of additional cost accruals. (Source 31)
        - Journal Entry for Cost Reversal: Dr. Accounts Payable $1,000,000 / Cr. Work-in-Progress $1,000,000. (Source 31, 32)
        - **Challenge:** Identify applicable AAOIFI FAS with weighted probability and reason. (Source 33)
    2. **Develop AI to Identify FAS:**
        - Keywords: "contract terms," "contract value," "revenue and cost projections," "Work-in-Progress."
        - The journal entry (reversing costs from WIP) strongly suggests a long-term construction or manufacturing type contract.
        - The provided "Correct Answer" is: FAS 10 (Istisna'a and Parallel Istisna'a) as highest weight. It should *not* include FAS 8 (Murabahah and Murabahah to the Purchase Orderer), FAS 19 (Contributions in Kind), or FAS 23 (Revenue Recognition from Exchange Transactions). (Source 33)
        - *AI's task:*
            - **FAS 10:** This standard specifically covers accounting for Istisna'a contracts, including how to account for contract variations, revenue, and costs (often using percentage of completion). The reversal of costs impacting WIP is consistent with Istisna'a accounting.
            - The AI should also be able to explain why other standards like FAS 8 (related to cost-plus sale) are not applicable.
- **Relevance to Islamic Finance Principles (for both examples):**
    - **Contractual Certainty (Istisna'a):** FAS 10 ensures that the accounting for Istisna'a contracts accurately reflects the specific nature of these agreements, where an item is manufactured to order. Changes and cancellations must be handled according to Shariah principles governing such contracts.
    - **Investment Structures (FAS 4, FAS 20):** Islamic finance utilizes various investment structures (Mudarabah, Musharakah, equity investments). AAOIFI standards provide guidance on accounting for these investments, ensuring transparency and adherence to Shariah tenets regarding risk-sharing and profit/loss distribution.
    - **Avoiding Gharar (Uncertainty):** Proper accounting and standard application reduce ambiguity and uncertainty in financial reporting for Islamic financial instruments and transactions.
- **Clarifying Ambiguities for Reverse Transaction #1 (GreenTech Buyout):**
    - The phrase "Al Baraka Bank buys out its stake" is slightly ambiguous. Does "its" refer to GreenTech's stake in something, or Al Baraka Bank buying out the entirety of GreenTech? The "100% ownership" implies the latter or achieving full control.
    - The journal entry "Dr. GreenTech Equity" is simplified. In an acquisition, the acquirer (Al Baraka Bank) would typically record the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, or an "Investment" account, rather than directly debiting the target's equity on its own books unless it's a consolidation entry eliminating the investment against the subsidiary's equity. The task seems to focus on FAS identification rather than the precise journal entry mechanics from the acquirer's perspective.
    - The inclusion of FAS 32 (Ijarah) in the "Correct Answer" for a stake buyout is not immediately obvious without further context. Teams will need to consider how an Ijarah contract could be relevant to this transaction (e.g., the nature of GreenTech's assets or business).

**Challenge Category 3: Standard Enhancement***(Reference: Page 2, Source 9-13; Page 7, Source 34-39)*

- **Core Objective:** To design and demonstrate (via prototype or conceptual model) a multi-agent AI system that can review, suggest, and validate updates or clarifications to a selected AAOIFI standard (FAS 4, 10, or 32 are specified for selection).
- **Step-by-Step Guidance for Designing the Multi-Agent System:**
    1. **Select a Standard:** Choose one from FAS 4, FAS 10, or FAS 32. (Source 34)
    2. **Agent 1: Review & Extraction (Source 10, 35):**
        - **Task:** This agent(s) processes the selected AAOIFI standard.
        - **Functionality:** Extracts key elements, definitions, principles, scope, recognition criteria, measurement rules, and disclosure requirements. It might also identify areas known for interpretative challenges or inconsistencies.
        - **AI Techniques:** Natural Language Processing (NLP) for text comprehension, information extraction, and potentially knowledge graph creation.
    3. **Agent 2: Proposing Modifications/Enhancements (Source 11, 36):**
        - **Task:** This agent(s) suggests AI-driven modifications or enhancements.
        - **Functionality:**
            - Compare the AAOIFI standard with other relevant global standards (e.g., IFRS) to identify gaps or areas for harmonization (while maintaining Shariah compliance).
            - Analyze contemporary financial instruments or transactions that may not be adequately covered by the current standard.
            - Use AI to identify patterns in queries or issues raised by practitioners regarding the standard.
            - Propose clearer wording, additional examples, or new sections.
        - **AI Techniques:** Comparative analysis, trend detection, NLP for generating suggested text.
    4. **Agent 3: Validation & Approval (Source 12, 37):**
        - **Task:** One or more agents validate proposed changes.
        - **Functionality:**
            - **Compliance Logic:** Check if proposed changes adhere to the overarching principles of AAOIFI and Shariah.
            - **Contextual Understanding:** Assess if the changes are practical and relevant to the current Islamic finance landscape.
            - **Alignment with Shariah Principles:** This is crucial. The agent must have a knowledge base of core Shariah principles (e.g., prohibition of Riba, Gharar, Maysir; principles of risk-sharing) and ensure no proposed change violates them. This might involve referencing AAOIFI Shariah Standards.
        - **AI Techniques:** Rule-based systems, expert systems, NLP for understanding Shariah texts, consistency checking.
    5. **System Interaction & Output (Source 13, 38, 39):**
        - **Expected Outcome:** A functional prototype or conceptual model illustrating how these agents interact.
        - **Key Features:**
            - Clear segregation of duties among agents.
            - Mechanism for proposing, reviewing, and validating changes.
            - Display reasoning and sources for each proposed amendment to ensure transparency and traceability.
            - Focus on maximizing accuracy and relevance of AI-generated updates.
- **Relevance to Islamic Finance Principles:**
    - **Dynamic Nature of Fiqh al-Muamalat (Islamic Commercial Jurisprudence):** While core Shariah principles are immutable, their application to new financial complexities requires ongoing Ijtihad (scholarly reasoning). AI can assist in this process by systematically analyzing information and suggesting solutions that remain true to Shariah.
    - **Ensuring Shariah Compliance:** The validation agent is critical for maintaining the integrity of Islamic finance standards. Any enhancement must strictly adhere to Shariah principles.
    - **Standardization and Harmonization:** Improving standards helps in consistent application across the global Islamic finance industry, fostering trust and growth.

**Challenge Category 4: Teams Own Category***(Reference: Page 2, Source 14; Page 7, Source 40)*

- **Core Objective:** To leverage skills developed in the previous categories to create a working prototype (proof of concept) of an AI-powered tool serving one of the listed objectives or a similar one.
- **Suggested Objectives (or similar to be enhanced):**
    1. **Financial Product Design:**
        - **Task:** Develop an AI tool that assists in designing new Shariah-compliant financial products.
        - **Functionality:** The AI could analyze proposed product structures against Shariah principles (e.g., checking for Riba, Gharar, Maysir), compare them with existing compliant products, review underlying contracts (Mudarabah, Musharakah, Salam, Istisna', Ijarah, etc.), and ensure adherence to relevant AAOIFI standards.
        - **Islamic Finance Relevance:** Innovation in product development is key, but Shariah compliance is paramount. AI can streamline the Shariah screening process.
    2. **Audit:**
        - **Task:** An AI tool to assist in auditing Islamic financial institutions.
        - **Functionality:** AI could analyze large transaction datasets to flag non-compliant transactions based on AAOIFI standards and Shariah rules (e.g., incorrect profit distribution in Mudarabah, prohibited investments). It could also assist in checking compliance with disclosure requirements.
        - **Islamic Finance Relevance:** Ensures that the practices of Islamic Financial Institutions align with professed Shariah principles and AAOIFI standards, enhancing stakeholder confidence.
    3. **Fraud and ML (Money Laundering) detection:**
        - **Task:** An AI tool tailored for detecting fraud and money laundering in the context of Islamic finance.
        - **Functionality:** While general AML/fraud detection techniques apply, AI could be trained to identify typologies or red flags specific to Islamic financial instruments or transaction patterns that might be exploited.
        - **Islamic Finance Relevance:** Upholding ethical practices and integrity is fundamental to Islamic finance.
    4. **Cross-Border (Multi-Jurisdictional) Compliance Advisor:**
        - **Task:** An AI tool that advises on compliance with AAOIFI standards and their varying interpretations or adoptions across different legal jurisdictions.
        - **Functionality:** The AI could maintain a knowledge base of AAOIFI standards, Shariah interpretations, and local regulatory requirements in different countries. It could then provide guidance on structuring transactions or products to be compliant across multiple jurisdictions.
        - **Islamic Finance Relevance:** The global Islamic finance industry faces challenges with differing scholarly opinions and regulatory landscapes. AI could help navigate this complexity.
- **Guidance:** Teams need to be creative, define a clear problem within one of these areas (or a similar one), and build a working prototype. The focus is on a "proof of concept."

### III. Clarifying Ambiguities (General)

- **"AAOIFI SS (Shariah Standards)" (Page 1, Source 3):** While FAS are Financial Accounting Standards, SS are Shariah Standards. The document implies that the selected FAS have corresponding Shariah Standards that teams must also be aware of. This is crucial because the accounting treatment in FAS is often derived from or must be consistent with underlying Shariah principles and contracts detailed in SS.
- **"Out-of-context" financial entries (Page 2, Source 7):** This implies that the journal entries provided in Category 2 will have minimal surrounding information, forcing the AI to rely heavily on the entry itself and limited contextual clues to deduce the relevant FAS.
- **"AI-driven modifications" (Page 2, Source 11):** In Category 3, this suggests that the AI should not just identify areas for improvement but also propose the *content* of these modifications, which then get validated.
- **"Conceptual model" vs. "Functional prototype" (Page 2, Source 13; Page 7, Source 38):** For Category 3 (Standard Enhancement), a "conceptual model" is acceptable if a full functional prototype is too complex. However, for Category 4 (Teams Own Category), a "working prototype (as proof of concept)" is explicitly required (Page 2, Source 14; Page 7, Source 40). The deliverables also state "Working AI powered solution/prototype" (Page 1, Source 2) as a general requirement.
